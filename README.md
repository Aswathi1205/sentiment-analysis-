# 🚀 Sentiment Analysis with LSTM  
Hey there! 👋 This project is all about teaching a computer to **understand emotions in text** using deep learning. Whether it's a happy movie review or a frustrated tweet, our LSTM model can figure it out!  

## 🌟 What’s Inside?  
- ✅ Cleans & preprocesses text data (so the model understands it better)  
- ✅ Uses **word embeddings** to give meaning to words  
- ✅ Trains a **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model** to classify sentiments  
- ✅ Prevents overfitting with **Dropout layers**  
- ✅ Evaluates the model & visualizes accuracy  

## 🛠 What You Need  
First, install the required dependencies:  
```
pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow
```

## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ Load and clean your dataset 📊  
2️⃣ Convert text into numerical form (Tokenization & Padding) 🔢  
3️⃣ Train the LSTM model 🧠  
4️⃣ Test it on new text and see if it's positive or negative! 🤖
